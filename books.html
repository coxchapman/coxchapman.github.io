			I had finished half of this book before diving into <em>The Great Believers</em>, so I didn't actually read it in two days. Christina Thompson's history of the settlement of Polynesia is an engaging and evenhanded look at the very puzzling historical question of exactly how the tiny and farflung islands of Polynesia came to be settled. She discusses James Cook's 18th century voyages and the remarkable Tahitian navigator Tupaia; racist theories about how Polynesians were actually Indo-European; and the archaeological evidence that enables us now to date waves of migration with relative precision. My favorite section, unsurprisingly, was her account of the so-called voyaging movement, of which David Lewis's <em>We, The Navigators</em> (see below) was an early and critical part. Still, it was helpful to put his work in context and learn more about the cultural significance of the movement to Hawaiians and its rocky history, including the loss of Eddie Aikau after the capsize of the canoe <em>Hokule'a</em> in 1980. I loved reading about the early computer simulation work done at the University of London that proved that the voyages could not have happened by drifting alone. Ultimately a fun, if somewhat light, survey of Pacific history. It made me want to get in a boat and go exploring.

			Whew I loved this book. The best novels are both gripping and literary, and <em>Believers</em> is solidly in that category. The plot centers around Chicago's Boystown gay scene in the early years of the AIDS epidemic, and flips back and forth between the 1980s and 2015. A few years ago I read a lot about the AIDS epidemic&mdash;Randy Shilts'<em>And The Band Played On</em>; David France's documentary <em>How to Survive a Plague</em>&mdash;and it is strangely fascinating to read about events that just barely preceded your own lifetime and thus historical consciousness. The book focuses on a young woman named Fiona, who has recently lost her brother to AIDS, and her brother's friends, who are mourning him while losing one another to the epidemic. One of the book's narrators is a young gay man named Yale Tishman, and part of the power of the novel is how it puts you in his shoes, and makes you feel the terror and anger and shame and confusion of that time. In a wonderful subplot, Yale discovers a trove of WWI-era art, and Makkai makes the connection between the nihilist destruction of the war and the ruthlessness of AIDS; how they both destroyed and galvanized the creative community. Highly recommended.

		<h2>House of the Spirits</h2>

			For years, I counted <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> as my favorite novel. I've read it twice, and probably am overdue for a re-read. I loved its grand sweep, its romance, and its use of myth to heighten its meaning. There are deep similarities between the two books, and I was a bit disappointed to learn that <em>House of the Spirits</em> was published in 1982, a full 15 years after <em>Solitude.</em> Still, there is enough richness here to recommend the book on its own. The women of the clan are the lifeblood of the book. Their clairvoyance, loyalty, and political righteousness animate the plot. Their masculine foil, Esteban Trueba, the patriarch of the clan, is a particularly complex character; he remains sympathetic even when his violence and mistreatment of everyone he loves has brought disaster on his family and his country. Beyond the characters, the plot is drawn from contemporary Chilean history. There is a famous poet who lives in a shiplike house on the coast, and a violent rebellion that leads to the death of a principled but ineffective President. Isabel Allende is the niece of Salvador Allende, and the plot coils and crumples toward the end after a languorous journey through the generations.

			<p>
			In a review of <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> for <a href = 'https://www.npr.org/2019/02/08/692415906/black-leopard-red-wolf-is-a-beast-of-a-book'>NPR</a>, Amal El-Mohtar writes,
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Reading <em> Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> was like being slowly eaten by a bear, one inviting me to feel every pressure of tooth and claw tearing into me, asking me to contemplate the intimacy of violation and occasionally cracking a joke.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The book is extraordinarily violent, and proceeds with the same dizzying density as James' <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em>. In a recent profile in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Jia Tolentino explored James' struggle to embrace his homosexuality in spite of a conservative religious upbringing in Jamaica, as well as his interest in African history and myth. Both strands are present in the book, with the mythical geography loosely based on historical African cultures and a lot of violent sexual imagery. Although I am interested in his Afrocentric take on fantasy and enjoyed some of the mythological elements of the book, overall I found the book hard to read.

			</p>
			<p>
			I finally got around to reading Rachel Kushner! And what a novel. <em>The Flamethrowers</em> centers around Reno, a young artist swept up into the chaos of 1970s New York. Reno is a wonderful, complex character, a three-dimensional woman who is ordinary enough to be believable. She falls into a relationship with Sandro Valera, the scion of a powerful Italian industrial family, and ends up in a spectacular crash while speed testing a Valera motorcycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Kushner references Italian Futurism and Land Art and the 1977 blackout; somehow all of these strands weave together into a rich and complex novel.

		<h2>Reinventing Bach</h2>
		<h3>Paul Elie</h3>

				<span class="marginnote">

			One of the perks of my apartment is that my upstairs neighbor is a cellist; I can hear her practicing as I write. It is a fact of my life that I am much more talented at being interested in art than I am at actually making it, and so after she and I discussed Bach one day, she recommended this book. To my surprise, Elie focuses on recordings of Bach, particularly those by Albert Schweitzer, Pablo Casals, and Glenn Gould. The remarkable thing is that Spotify has many of the recordings mentioned in the book, so I would listen to <a href ="https://open.spotify.com/album/3xtxxrG3jrsisffEJrON5s?si=TFTI8fMNSOKgdD2V-FYvlA">Schweitzer's early 1935 recording</a> of Bach's Toccatas, made in a 900-year-old church in London on the eve of the Second World War. Elie's descriptions made the listening experience much richer because I could hear what Schweitzer was putting into his playing. He describes how Gould made the recording studio an instrument, and how Casals used music to lodge a decades-long personal protest against the Franco regime in Spain. I have also been listening to several music podcasts ("Switched on Pop" and "Song Exploder," particularly), and what I love is the way music combines engineering with art, analysis with creativity. An A is 440 Hz, but that doesn't explain why we feel something when we listen to Bach's Chaccone. The book is less successful in its biographical treatment of Bach's life, but worth it for its explanation of some beloved recordings.

		<h2>Speak, Memory</h2>
		<h3>Vladimir Nabokov</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="marginnote">
				  <img height="200px" src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CbAYuvmsL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			<em>Speak, Memory</em> is Nabokov's autobiography. It covers the years between his earliest memories in 1903 (he was born in 1899) through his departure for the US in 1940. I find Nabokov endlessly fascinating: English was his third language after Russian and French; his long, rambling road trips with Vera through the US in the '50s; his obsession with butterflies. The pleasures of <em>Speak, Memory</em> are twofold: first, the historical interest of a life lived across the cataclysms of the 20th century, and second, the astonishingly beautiful writing. Nabokov's family was prominent, as his father and grandfather served in the Tsar's government. They lived in mansions in St. Petersburg and decamped for a country estate in the summers. In many ways, prerevolutionary Russia was still feudal, and Nabokov's family was on the right side of society. It is poignant to consider how wrenching modernity would be for Russia&mdash; with progress would come unimaginable horror.
			</p> 
			<p>
			As an aside, Nabokov's vocabulary is immense. Below are the words I scribbled into the frontispiece and looked up later:
			<blockquote>
				palpebral: adj, relating to the eyelids <br/>
				fatidic: adj, of or relating to prophecy <br/>
				blackamoor: n, a black person <br/>
				frass: n, fine powdery refuse or fragile perforated wood produced by the activity of boring insects <br/>
				aquarelle: a style of painting using thin, typically transparent, watercolors <br/>
				xanthic: adj, yellow <br/>
				ecchymotic: adj, bruised <br/>
				enuretic: adj, relating to wetting the bed <br/>
				refulgent: adj, shining brightly <br/>
				nictitating: v, blinking <br/>
				quiddity: n, the inherent essence of someone or something <br/>
				purblind: adj, having impaired or defective vision; dimwitted <br/>
				nankeens: n, a yellowish cotton cloth; pants made of nankeen <br/>

		<h2>The Better Angels of Our Nature</h2>
		<h3>Steven Pinker</h3>

				<span class="marginnote">

			<p>
			Occasionally, usually without intending to, my reading takes on themes. A few years ago there was a series of novels that took on race in America; another time it was the War on Terror. The last few books I've read have been about the human capacity for cruelty. Pinker's book is the broadest of them all. His project is to show that over the last two thousand years, violence has declined precipitously. The first half of the book is an exhaustive sociological survey of death rates by violence (expressed per 100,000 people) and an exploration of the forces that have made that rate go down. The second half is a psychological and evolutionary exploration of humanity and how we are capable of both cruelty and grace. I appreciate Pinker's rigorous style; he stays close to the data and debunks many of the sillier claims about human nature. Pinker is an Englightenment liberal, in the classical sense, and he explains the various strains of Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment thought in a clear and cogent way. The book is rich and fascinating and is a feast for further thought: the roots of the Holocaust, the surprising uptick of violence in the peace-and-love '60s, and the statistical likelihood of a third World War. If there's a gap in the book, it's about European colonization &mdash; while the violence was more indirect (famines instead of wars), it still killed an enormous number of people. Overall, eye-opening and rigorous, and fundamentally optimistic.

		<h2>Bury the Chains</h2>
		<h3>Adam Hochschild</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="marginnote">

				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			Hochschild is one of my favorite writers; this is the fifth book of his I've read. He's a classic human-rights liberal &mdash; he was a founder of <em>Mother Jones</em>, and his histories focus on popular movements like anticolonialism (<em>King Leopold's Ghost</em>), resistance to the First World War (<em>To End All Wars</em>), and resistance to Fascism (<em> Spain in Our Hearts</em>). <em>Bury the Chains</em> is solidly in that vein as the story of the British movement to end the slave trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Hochschild paints a vivid portrait of the contradictions of Enlightenment England. It was a deeply religious era, but one making great advancements in science. It was a time of cruel punishments and harsh working conditions, but also of cosmopolitanism and expanding literacy which led to more humane perspectives. The heroes of Hochschild's narrative are a small group of Quakers, Anglican clergy, and politicians who carefully documented the atrocities of the slave trade and brilliantly activated popular resistance, including now-familiar tactics like boycotts, petitions, and direct mail. The way they moved public (and political) opinion from slavery as a distasteful but inevitable fact of life to an unacceptable moral outrage is an inspiring lesson.

		<h2>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</h2>
		<h3>Richard Rhodes</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="marginnote">
				  <img height="200px" src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TkiyTaO2L._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			Rhodes' book opens with the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard stepping off a London curb and having a vision &mdash; inspired by an HG Wells novel &mdash; of atomic weapons. The book then traces the thirty-year project of theoretical insight, painstaking experimental research, and finally military-industrial achievement that produced the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As I read the history I reflected on three ideas: first, that the race to build the bomb was the last time that science was seen as "Progress" and as an unalloyed good. The aftermath of WWII and the recognition of what industrial "Progress" had wrought &mdash; from the Holocaust to the bomb &mdash; would rightly give rise to political critiques of industrialism, as in the environmental movement. The second idea is the aesthetic of the "atomic age," with its mushroom clouds and control rooms. Rhodes' description of the first Trinity test, held only three weeks before Hiroshima, is extraordinary for its otherworldliness. Finally, I was struck by the prescience of purpose and pace of development. The physics community knew they could build a bomb almost as soon as the war started. Most of the work was scaling up industrial processes; they went from isolating a few micrograms of plutonium in 1943 to creating several pounds of it for a bomb in 1945.

				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			Doerr is rightfully famous for his novel <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>, and this remarkable collection runs over similar concerns as the novel. Doerr's characters have rich internal lives, vivid relationships with nature, and often, some characteristic that holds them apart from the world. The first two stories in the collection are some of the best I've ever read &mdash; in particular the title story, about a blind shell collector who inadvertently discovers a miracle cure in a toxic snail, and in "The Hunter's Wife," about a taciturn Montana hunter and the mystical powers of his wife. Highly recommended.

		<h2>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</h2>

				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			<em>Thousand Autumns</em> is the third Mitchell novel I've read, after <em>Bone Clocks</em> and <em>Cloud Atlas</em>. It has a similar ambitious sweep as the previous books, but is more grounded and less sci-fi. <em>Cloud Atlas</em> remains my favorite of his work, but I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The story takes place in the late 18th century in a Dutch trading outpost just off the coast of Nagasaki. The title character is a decent and ambitious young Dutchman who has traveled to "the East" to seek his fortune and earn enough to marry in the Netherlands. He gets tangled in a complex story of corruption, imperial geopolitics, and the internal politics of Japan during the Shogunate. Japan was famously hostile to outsiders until it was forcibly opened to trade in 1854, and Mitchell does a serviceable job of writing about Japanese characters and their culture during that era.

		<h2>The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility</h2>

			<p>
			I've wanted to read Stuart Brand for a while now, but never got around to it. He has a very Northern-California sensibility as a thinker, since he's a futurist and a technologist as well as an environmentalist. That separates him from some others in the environmental movement, who see technology as primarily a threat to the natural world. The book was published in 1999, right at the height of hype about "the Net," and the book is littered with references to dot-com era figures like Jaron Lanier and Brewster Kahle. The book is a series of meditations on what it means to hold a very long perspective &mdash; Brand suggests 10,000 years. It's an elegant way to force ourselves to consider both stewardship of resources and the folly of many of our pursuits. One of the most useful ideas in the book is a diagram showing the relative rates of change of societal forces: Fashion changes most quickly, followed by Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, and finally, Nature.

			I bought this novel thinking it was by Rachel <em>Kushner</em>, not Rachel Cusk. I'd read a profile of Kushner and was interested in her work, but so it goes. My misunderstanding made <em>Outline</em> more interesting, especially after the fact; I had to recalibrate my understanding of the book. The novel is quiet and intelligent, the kind of book you're not completely sure you've grasped after the first read-through. The narrator, a novelist, is unnamed, and she reveals herself to us only through the reflection of her conversations. In that way, the title functions on a few levels: we see the narrator faintly, as in a visual outline, and we see only the outline of her story, as if it is an unfinished novel.

			A 700 page novel about the magisterial sweep of the colonization of North America and its ecological legacy? Yes please. The book traces two French indentured servants who wind up in New France in the 1600s, following their descendants all the way into the 21st century. It weaves together ecological and political history; I found myself thinking often of Bill Cronon's <em>Changes in the Land</em> or <em>Nature's Metropolis</em>. My only disappointment was that by the end we were racing through generations, but overall a fun and broad read.

			Another book about maps! The genesis of Google maps came from two startups acquired by Google: a team of 30 called Keyhole, that built what we know as Google Earth, and another, called Where2Technologies, which had only four people and contributed some of the core technology for the smooth, fast "slippy" maps we use today. Kilday was the head of marketing at Keyhole, and his biases, toward his original team and to marketing, are evident. Still, it's an eye-opening look at how recent digital mapping technology is. Some of the product decisions they made then, like being inspired by the Eames film <em>Powers of Ten</em>, still shape how we view maps on the web today. Google made the acquisitions after seeing that 25% of web searches had a geographical component; location matters!

			<p>
			<em>The White Album</em>'s title essay famously opens "We tell ourselves stories in order to live," and this volume is Didion's second attempt to make sense of the Sixties. Published in 1979, it's the followup to <em>Slouching Toward Bethlehem</em>, and overall the book is looser; there's less of a sense of mission to what she's trying to say. "The White Album," the essay, details a psychiatric episode, and you get the sense that her own crackup mirrors the country's. Her essays about feminism are nuanced and arch, and her treatment of California adds depth to a place that often feels quite shallow, historically.

			<p>
			Book 5, subtitled "Some Rain Must Fall," felt different than the rest of the <em>My Struggle</em> series. It's more novelistic and less automatic; the book is more of a traditional narrative than the tight, intensely felt vignettes of the earlier books, and the pacing dragged more than the others. Perhaps that's intentional &mdash; it covers a long period of creative frustration, self-destruction, and self-doubt in Karl Ove's life. There are parts of the book that are almost frightening, like when he hurls a glass at his brother in a drunken rage or cuts himself soon after meeting a woman he would later marry. Still, you root for him. I was surprised to find out that I've caught up: Book 6 will be released in late September, and weighs in at a staggering 1200 pages.

			<p>
			Every once in a while, a nonfiction book comes around that turns my thinking upside down, and I'll be adding <em>Scale</em> to the list (Others include <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em> by Jared Diamond and <em>The Information</em> by James Gleick). West is a physicist, and he uses the theoretical tools of physics to look at biological and human systems. The core idea of the book is that universal physical laws emerge from the ruthless optimization of evolution, which gives us predictive power. For example, every mammal gets about 1.5 billion heartbeats; a mouse just churns through them much faster than an elephant. Further, there's a literal economy of scale for the elephant &mdash; its cells sustain much less damage than high-intensity mouse cells, and so it lives much longer. The book is full of cool insights, like the fact that if you could bundle up every leaf stem on a tree, the area of the bundle would equal the cross-sectional area of the tree trunk. The later chapters, about companies and cities, are a bit more speculative, but suggest an ecology of human systems that could be incredibly powerful.

		<h2>My Struggle: Book 4</h2>

			<p>
			A lot of the critical discussion of <em>My Struggle</em> centers on how quotidian it is; the series is usually described as "both tedious and gripping." The description implies that the book is a diary, or an exhaustive account of Knausgaard's days, which isn't quite right. Each volume centers on a discrete period in his life, and on a discrete and illustrative set of events within that period. There's a substantial amount of artistry and storytelling to create the combination of "tedious and gripping." Volume 4 recounts Knausgaard's year as a teacher in a small town in northern Norway. He learns how to be an adult and furiously trying to become a writer. The mistakes of early adulthood are grand and painful, and he's no exception. It's cathartic to relive them through his writing.

			<p>
			Book 3 of the <em>My Struggle</em> series, subtitled "Boyhood," is set across Karl Ove's childhood. There's less self-awareness; kids don't know a lot, and he captures what it feels like to slowly learn more about the world. He learns about girls, and sports, and mischief, and social taboos. One of my favorite works about childhood is <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> &mdash; something both the book and the movie get right is the volatility of being a kid. While "Boyhood" is much less whimsical, it put me right back into the drama of growing up. Book 4 is on order.

			I'm sorry to say that this book is not very good. It seemed promising: a bestseller focused on geography and maps, that uses the natural world to explain geopolitics. Unfortunately it was superficial and light, and in each chapter I found myself thinking back to other books that took on the similar material in much greater and more interesting depth.

			<p>
			Well, I think I'm hooked. The second volume is subtitled <em>A Man in Love</em> and with any of Knausgaard's titles, there's irony: the book focuses mostly on the tensions and contradictions of being a middle-aged parent rather than the rush of romance. Children are both maddening and meaningful; he explores both the power of the experience and the toll it puts on his career and on his marriage.

			I've been curious about <em>My Struggle</em> for a few years, but always felt too daunted to dig in. The weirdly Hitlerian title, the Scandinavian seriousness, and the prospect of embarking on a 3,600 page autobiographical project made it hard to start. The books are often tedious, but still  gripping; the power comes from a sense of identification with his inner monologue. Knausgaard manages to capture what it feels like to be a thinker and an observer of your own life.

			<p>
			I was not terribly impressed with <em>Purity</em>. It's a fast read, and fun and suspenseful at times, but I kept wondering if it would attract attention if not written by Franzen. The plot centers around a plucky young woman (the eponymous Purity, aka Pip) who gets involved with a mysterious transparency organization similar to Wikileaks. The book is supposedly centered around Pip, but ends up examining a complicated relationship between men, and the book's female characters felt incidental and light.

			<em>Native Son</em> was sitting on a free paperback cart as I boarded my flight from Boston to San Francisco last week, and I read it on my flight home. The novel directly takes on the claustrophobic feeling of being an urban black man in the 20th century in a way that I found surprising compared to other books of the era, and I found myself reading the book for its politics more than its literature.

			<p>
			This book made me sad. David Foster Wallace is one of my favorite writers, but I've neglected his short stories (still to read: <em>The Broom of the System</em> and <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>). <em>Oblivion</em> was published in 2004, only a few years before he killed himself in 2008. The stories have his usual frenetic pace and vocabulary, but where that pace feels fresh and intelligent in his other work, it's harder to see its purpose here. There are the typical themes of bureaucratic ennui and meaninglessness, but the stories are somehow sadder and less compassionate to their hapless characters.

			<em>White Tears</em> is a novel about race and music, and I devoured it in an evening. Two young men start a record label devoted to unearthing old Black music, and they discover some very dark realities. It's a gripping thriller (in fact tips into horror, at points), but is ultimately light on historical resonance, mostly because its black characters are thin caricatures, or villains. The book owes a lot to <em>Invisible Man</em>; I found myself thinking back to high school, when I discovered Louis Armstrong's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LDPUfbXRLM">"Black and Blue"</a>.

			<em>Footsteps</em> is an anthology of <em>New York Times</em> articles that trace the footsteps of famous authors. Abbey gave me the book for my birthday. I'd never read the feature in the paper, but I loved this book. I learned things about authors I knew very little about: Rimbaud never wrote poetry after age 21, died at 37, and lived for a long time in Ethiopia. Who knew! I read the book on a business trip to Berlin and learned that Isherwood lived near the office; I hadn't known that Mark Twain had written about Hawaii for the <em>Sacramento Union.</em> Each piece has a unique angle, so they never get repetitive. It's a rare book that manages to be intellectually stimulating yet still light.

			<p>
				 <em>Embracing Defeat</em> focuses on the years of American occupation, from 1945-1952, and examines fascinating questions of societal transformation, moral responsibility for catastrophe, and hard compromises for the victors following capitulation. For every radical decision (disbanding the <em>zaibatsu</em>, writing pacifism into the Constitution), there were equally conservative decisions (retaining the Emperor, most conspicuously). The interaction of the Japanese response to defeat and American policy choices forged modern Japan, and the book is an indispensable guide to the period.

		<h2>We, The Navigators</h2>

			<p>
				David Lewis spent 5 years in Polynesia learning from the last of the traditional navigators, and he collects his research in this tremendous monograph, now in its second edition. It's an academic book, so can be a bit dry at times, but his methodical approach is welcome for its comprehensiveness. While Western navigators (before GPS) would attempt a sun sight once a day, and then fix their position on a static map, for the Polynesians, navigation was a continual process of integrating observed data into a picture of their location. And what a rich set of data it was! There's the "sidereal compass," or the position of stars on the horizon as they rise; navigating by judging the refraction of swell around islands in order to expand the "landfall target"; learning the homing behavior of birds 20 miles offshore; or most remarkably, using deep-sea phosphorescence to detect islands up to 80 miles away. Reading Lewis's account of his voyages made me want to go offshore in the South Pacific or at least become a much closer observer of natural phenomena in my backyard.

				This is a fun book, and not just because I have a professional interest in GPS technology. It's an engaging history and an approachable but sophisticated technology explainer. The history of GPS winds throught the Cold War, the "smart bombs" of the Gulf War, and finally exploded into civilian applications in the late '90s. Milner dives into a number of fascinating side-subjects, from <a href="http://www.sensorystudies.org/inuit-orienting-traveling-along-familiar-horizons/">Inuit navigation in the far north</a> to <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/global-impositioning-systems/">how GPS turn-by-turn changes our minds</a> to geodesy, or the study of the shape of the Earth.

				<em>Fates and Furies</em> lives up to its title. One reviewer described Groff as "writing as if her hands are on fire" and the book's twisty plot reminded me of <em>Gone Girl</em>. There are some thin spots, particularly in the extremes of the characters: cartoonish villainy, unlimited money, unlimited charm, unlimited anger. But overall a fun, literate, and fast-paced read which offers some complex thoughts on marriage and art.

				Michael Chabon's characters are usually bright, and loud: the superheroes of <em>The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay</em> or the Jews at the end of the world in <em>The Yiddish Policeman's Union</em>. In <em>Moonglow</em>, he's still dealing with his themes of Judaism, literature, and complex families, but the book is much quieter. The book is a fictionalized account of conversations with the narrator's grandfather; the narrator is also named Michael Chabon, and the book is propulsive but not suspenseful. It's a novel, with a novel's elegant plotlines, but retains the circumstantial revelations of memoir.

				Didion's book of essays is billed as an examination of "the atomization of modern life." All the essays in the book were written between 1961 and 1967, and reading them now is both an exercise in history&mdash;since she is writing for a contemporary audience&mdash;and in reflection, since in many ways it feels like "the center cannot hold" in 2017 America. My favorite essays are the title essay, about the hippies of the Haight, and "On Keeping a Notebook," which is about what it means to observe the world as a writer.

The book is violent and hard to follow, with multiple narrators speaking in multiple dialects, but I learned a lot about Jamaica in the '70s. The book won the Man Booker prize in 2015, beating out a strong shortlist, including Hanya Yanigihara's <em>A Little Life</em> (which I have read) and Sunjeev Suhota's <em>Year of the Runaways</em> (which I have not).
